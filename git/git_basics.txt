- Git is a version control system
- Developed by Linus Trovalds to help with the development of Linux

A git repo contains the following:
    - Files managed by git
    - History of everything since tracking with git
    - hidden .git folder

#==========
# Using Git
#==========

# Create repo locally
git init -> Must done inside your src directory.
Create new repo on GitHub. Let's call it NewRepo
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/newrepo.git
git push -u origin master (first push to GitHub)

# Removing the .git folder.
# If u created it in a wrong folder
rm -rf .git

# Get exisiting code from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/...

# Check for modifications
git status

# Undersanding git's 3 local states
1. Working directory -> Your working files
2. Staging area -> Used prepare for the next commit
3. Repository (.git folder) -> All commited changes
After commiting file, they are sent to the remote repo

# Add files to track
git add file_name -> adds specific file
git add . -> adds all files to the staging area

# Send files to staging area
git commit -m "message about what what was done"

# How to unstage file
git rm --cached <file>

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b BranchName

# Create a Pull Request (PR)
Alerts a repo's owner that you want to make some changes.
Pull request is the same as Merge Request
STEPS:
1: Fork the owner's repo in you own account. Basically making a copy
2: Clone the forked repo locally to make changes
3: Make the changes
4: Add, commit, & push the changes up to GitHub
5: Send pull request to repo owner

# Pull from GitHub
git pull origin master

# See all recent changes
git log

# Switch back to master branch
git checkout master
