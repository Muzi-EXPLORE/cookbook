- Git is a version control system
- Developed by Linus Trovalds to help with the development of Linux

A git repo contains the following:
    - Files managed by git
    - History of everything since tracking with git
    - hidden .git folder

# Create repo locally
git init - Must done inside your src directory.
Create new repo on GitHub. Let's call it NewRepo
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/newrepo.git
git push -u origin master (first push to GitHub)

# Get exisiting code from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/...

# Check if any modifications
git status

# Add files to track
git add <file> - adds specific file
git add . - adds all files

# Send files to staging area
git commit -m "message about what what was done"

# How to unstage file
git rm --cached <file>

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b BranchName

# Create a Pull Request (PR)
Alerts a repo's owner that you want to make some changes.
Pull request is the same as Merge Request
STEPS:
1: Fork the owner's repo in you own account. Basically making a copy
2: Clone the forked repo locally to make changes
3: Make the changes
4: Add, commit, & push the changes up to GitHub
5: Send pull request to repo owner

# Pull from GitHub
git pull origin master

# See all recent changes
git log

# Switch back to master branch
git checkout master
